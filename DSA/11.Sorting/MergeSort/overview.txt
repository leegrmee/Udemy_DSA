break in a half, repeat it until you have a list of one element

break a list in a half
base case = if length of list is 1
and then, merge the list

The other sorting algorithms(selection, insertion, bubble) sort the list in place.
That is to say the original list is sorted 

But with merge sort, the original list stays the same and a new list is created.

Big of
- Time Complexity: O(n log n)
 -> The number of operations is log n when the list is broken in a half.
 -> The number of operations is n when the list is merged. While loop goes through each element one by one to combine these into a list.

- Space Complexity: O(n)
 -> Space Complexity is O(n) because a new list is created.
 -> The number of items being stored in memory have been doubled.
