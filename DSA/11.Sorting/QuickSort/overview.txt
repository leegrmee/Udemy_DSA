Quick Sort

- Choose a pivot
- Compare each element with the pivot 
- If the element is less than the pivot, put it in the left list
- If the element is greater than the pivot, put it in the right list
- Repeat the process for each list
- Combine the lists

Time Complexity: O(n log n)
 - The worst case is O(n^2) if you have a sorted list
 - If you have a sorted list, you can use insertion sort, because it has generally O of n^2, 
 but it has a best case of O(n) if the list is already sorted.

Space Complexity: O(log n)
