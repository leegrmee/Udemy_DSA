Tree Traversla is a way to visit every node in a tree and get the value , put them in a list.
And then return the list.
But, notice that tree is not a linear data structure.

Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Visit every node on the same level before moving on to the next level.

Depth First Search (DFS)
- Preorder : visit the root and write the value of it, then visit the left, then the right.

- Postorder : visit the node, look left and right, and if there is no left or right, then write the value of it. 

- Inorder : visit the left and writ the value of it, and then visit the right and write the value of it. 
 it is used to get the value in order which means to write the value in numerical order
