Double Linked List
data structure that consists of a set of nodes, each of which contains a value and two pointers, 
one pointing to the previous node in the list and one pointing to the next node in the list. 

The main advantage of a doubly linked list is that 
it allows for efficient traversal of the list in both directions.
