Recursion 
- A fuction is that calls iteself until it dosen't
- For recursion to work, we need to have a base case and a recursive case.
- the base case is the condition that stops the recursion.
- the recursive case is the condition that calls the function again which means the function is repeating itself.

Recap
The necessary condition for recursion is 
1) Base case for stop calling itself - if you don't have this, the fucntion will keep calling itself until it crashes =stack overflow
2) Return satetment to stop the fucntion
3) Recursive case to get closer to the base case

example: Call Stack, Factorial, Fibonacci, Tree Traversal, etc.
