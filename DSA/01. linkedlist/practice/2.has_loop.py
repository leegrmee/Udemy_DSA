"""
Floydâ€™s Cycle Algorithm or Tortoise And Hare algorithm
 -is a pointer algorithm that uses only two pointers, moving through the sequence at different speeds.
  - Initially, if the slow pointer is at a distance k from a certain point in the cycle, then after one iteration, the distance between the slow and fast pointers becomes k+1. 
  - After two iterations, this distance becomes k+2 and so on. 
  - As they continue to move within the cycle, this distance will eventually equal the cycle length n
