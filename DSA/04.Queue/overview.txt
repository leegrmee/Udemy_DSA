Queue

FIFO

add(enqueue), remove(dequeue) = O of 1

For something to be a queue, you add on one end and remove from the other end

implement a queue using a linked list

- add at the end = O of 1, remove from end = O of n
- add at the front = O of 1, remove from front = O of 1

So,if we enqueue from the end and dequeue from the front
 -> because both of those are O of 1

 first -> front
 last -> back

*Big O 
Both adding to and removing from a Queue is O(1).
