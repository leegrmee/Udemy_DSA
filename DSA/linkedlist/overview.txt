Linked List under the hood

Linked List : 
-does not have indexes
-is in noncontiguous place in memory 
-has a head that points to the first node, tail - the last node , and each node points to the next node
-last node points to None


Node : Value and Pointer make up the Node
it's essentially a 'dictionary'



head: 
{
    "value": 7, 
    "next": 
    {
        "value": 10,
        "next": 
        {
            "value": 15,
            "next": None
        }
    }
}
