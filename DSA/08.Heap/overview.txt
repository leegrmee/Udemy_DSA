Heap
is a binary tree / complete tree
* height of the binary search tree is lon n.
 >>예를 들어, 노드가 약 8개면, height는 3이다. (2^3 = 8)
 
 
 In heap, each node that is higher than its descendants is always greater than its descendants.
 Different from BST, heap can have duplicate values.

 Max Heap: the greatest value is at the top of the heap.
 Min Heap: the smallest value is at the top of the heap.
   >>in this case, all the child nodes are greater than the parent node.

Heaps are not good for searching.
 >> because there is no order in the heap other than all of the descendants are less than or eqaul to the parent node.
Heap is useful for sorting the biggest or smallest values and removing it.
