Stack
LIFO

- let's say we have a web browser and we go to Facebook, then we go to Google, then we go to Youtube, then we go to Twitter.
- if we want to go back to the previous page, we can use the back button.
- this is because the web browser uses a stack to keep track of the pages we have visited.
- the back button pops the last page from the stack and shows it to us.
- this is a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure.

Stacks are commonly implemented with either Lists or Linked Lists.
implement a stack using a list
- add, remove at the end= O of 1
- add, remove on the other end = O of n <- reindexing is needed

implement a stack using a linked list
- the first node should be the top of the stack so that add and remove are O of 1

*Big O 
Both pushing onto and popping from a Stack is O(1).
